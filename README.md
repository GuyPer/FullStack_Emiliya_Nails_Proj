# Fullstack Project - Business Web "Emiliya Nails Art"

## Overview

This Fullstack project, built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), is a business website for "Emiliya Nails Art". The repository contains a responsive application demonstrating both front-end and back-end development skills. It uses technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, TypeScript, and React for the front end, and Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for the back end.

## Project Description

The project aims to create a user-friendly platform for both clients and the admin:

Clients can browse the business's portfolio, register as new users to purchase products, schedule appointments, and contact the business owner across different platforms.
Admin users can manage products and gallery (create, edit, and delete), monitor user activity, and remove users when necessary.
The back-end server is built using JavaScript with the Express framework to handle HTTP requests via various middleware.
